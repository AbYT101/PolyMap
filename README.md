# PolyMap 
# (Lists events in Poly campus, Bahirdar University)

It is a friendly android app that lists events on poly campus as an anchor on the map and displays the details of that particular event. 

Anyone can register a new event with its details.
The app calculates the route to the events location and estimates time travel. 
We have used Here maps SDK for the deployment of the map.

More feature coming up...
